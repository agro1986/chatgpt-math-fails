# ChatGPT Math Fails

This repository is a collection of ChatGPT fails when answering university (undergraduate) textbook level math questions.
At first I wanted to relearn math with the assistance of ChatGPT, thinking that its assistance will supercharge my learning.
However it turned out that I was the one having to correct and teach ChatGPT math.

## Technical details

* The version used is ChatGPT 4o from the website as a pro user (not API/playground).
* Memory and custom instructions are turned off.
* No extra prompting such as "think step by step".
* When an exercise asks for a bunch of independent questions (such as "prove the statements a, b, and c"),
  I ask the questions separately (such as "prove the statement a").
